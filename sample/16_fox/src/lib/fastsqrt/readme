Umm.... just a few things I use in my game.

fastflot.h: contains an inline fast float to int rounder. Do not pass in
            anything greater or equal to 2^23.
fastsqrt.c
and
fastsqrt.h: put them together, you get a roughly 3x faster than fsqrt sqrt()
            In general, you'll want to call fast_fsqrt_asm(), but the
            original Graphics Gems fast_fsqrt() is still in there in C
            for reference.
            Call build_sqrt_table() first!
            The drawback to this routine is that you can be up to, I think 6%
            off in your answer. But in a supa-fast 3d engine where no one
            would notice the diff anyway, there you go.

If you're not getting this directly from my site, they originally came
from

or

My main page is

quite a feast for the senses, I hope.
