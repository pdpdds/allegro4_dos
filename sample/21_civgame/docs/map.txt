Map
---

Tiles are 24x24.

The standard tile set has these definitions:

o Grass (Buffer)
o Water
o Forest
o Hills
o Mountains
o Desert
o Swamp
o Road

Custom map styles may define any number of tiles.

The buffer tile acts as a border around all other tiles. All other tiles must
have a set of transitions to this buffer.
