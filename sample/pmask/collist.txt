COLLIST: What is it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


COLLIST is a C library for dealing with collision lists.  

COLLIST implements highly efficient optimized bounding box collision 
detection for dealing with sets of bounding boxes.  It uses PMASKs 
pixel-pefect collisions as a "second pass", but that can be easily 
disabled if you prefer to just use raw bounding-box collisions, or if 
you want to supply your own "second pass" collision detection.  

Basically, to summarize what this library does, you give it a list of 
objects with bounding boxes, and it gives you a list of collisions.  
This is usually better than checking for collisions yourself, because 
this library uses "better than O(n^2)" algorithms so that it doesn't 
have to check every pair of objects for collisions.  For an idea of
the performance offered, take a look at the example program.

COLLIST: So... how do I use it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


COLLIST_ITEM is defined like this:

struct COLLIST_ITEM {
	float x, y, w, h;
	void *userdata;
};

The first four items correspond to the bounding box of your object.  
x and y are the upper left-hand corner coordintes.  w and h are the 
width and height of the bounding box.  

The "userdata", as mentioned earlier, is an identifier for the object, and 
can be anything at all so long as your item-getting and collision-handling 
callback functions know how to understand the identifiesr you use.  


There are 6 types of interaction with the COLLIST library:

1. Initialization: call create_collist
	This should happen first, and generally only needs to happen once.  
Pretty easy.  To initialize the library, you call create_collist, and pass 
it a pointer at the item-getting callback function.  Basically what that 
is is a function that you define which COLLIST calls whenever if needs data 
about one of your objects.  That function mediates between your programs 
data and COLLISTs data.  I'll discuss what you need to do about that later 
(see #3 below).  Anyway, create_collist returns a pointer at a COLLIST_LIST 
struct.  You don't need to look at any of the data in the COLLIST_LIST, you 
just need to pass it to all the later functions.  Oh yeah, there's a 
destroy_collist function to, but who cares?  

2.  Object Creation: call add_to_collist
	Each time you create a new collidable object, you should call the 
add_to_collist function.  You pass it a COLLIST_LIST pointer and some 
kind of identifier for the freshly created object.  Object identifiers take 
the form of a void pointer.  Generally, I would recommend that you use a 
pointer at your objects data.  However, they don't HAVE to be valid 
pointers or anything; you could use integers if you prefer, and just cast 
them to void pointers.  Identifiers need to be unique, and they need to be 
castable to void pointers and back without loss of information.  Those are 
the only requirements.  

3.  Object Data Mediation: the item-getting callback function
	Obviously, COLLIST can't tell if your objects are colliding from 
just their identifiers; it needs more information than that.  That's where 
this function comes in.  You must define a function which takes a pointer 
at a COLLIST_ITEM struct.  When COLLIST needs to know some data about one 
of your objects, it will call this function and pass the address of the 
COLLIST_ITEM where you should stick the data.  That COLLIST_ITEM will 
already have the member variable "userdata" set to one of the identifiers 
that you passed to add_to_collist.  You should then fill in the other 
member variables of COLLIST_ITEM with data about the object which userdata 
identifies.  The member variables include bounding box data and a pointer 
at a PMASK.  This is the function that you passed to create_collist during 
initialization (see #1 above).  

4.  Requesting Collisions: call do_collist_collisions
	This one is simple - when you want to check for collisions, call 
do_collist_collisions.  The first parameter should be the COLLIST_LIST 
pointer that was returned by the call to create_collist during 
initialization.  The second parameter should be the collision callback 
function discussed in #5 below.  Use NULL for the third parameter 
(just forget about the third parameter... it's not really useful... 
most of the time anyway).  

5.  Recieving Collisions: the collisions callback function
	You must also declare a collision callback function to recieve 
lists of collisions.  When you call do_collist_collisions as described in 
#4 above, you pass the address of your collision callback function.  If 
do_collist_collisions detects one or more collisions, it will call this 
function.  This function accepts as parameters an integer and a pointer at 
an array of void pointers.  The integer is a number of collisions which 
you are being notified of.  The array of void pointers contains... pairs 
of void pointers.  How many pairs?  One pair per collision.  These void 
pointers are in fact, the identifiers that you passed to add_to_collist 
earlier.  Thus, what you have here is the identifiers of the objects that 
collided.  Hopefully you have something meaningful to do with these 
identifiers; that's not COLLISTs job, but the example program does include 
some simplified newtonian mechanics if that's your cup of tea.  

6.  Object destruction: bleh
	Object destruction is a little weirder than object creation.  From 
how add_to_collist worked, you might expect that you could remove an object 
just by calling remove_from_collist and passing it a COLLIST_LIST pointer 
and an identifier for the object to remove.  In fact, technically, you're 
right.  That will work.  Unfortunately, that's kinda slow if you do a lot 
of object destruction.  That's why there's an alternate, faster version.  
However, the faster version can only be used by the item-getting callback 
function, and only when that function is called for the object that you 
want to delete.  The alternate version is called 
remove_from_collist_during_callback.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PORTABILITY & PLATFORMS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Mostly portable.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


COLLIST is completely unaware of things like "time" and "velocity".  It 
will detect if two objects overlap, but it can not detect if they pass 
through each other between ticks.  That is, if objects are at velocities 
high enough then they have the potential to pass right through objects that 
are small relative to the distance that they move per physics tick.  In the
next release, I'll add an example showing the use of sweep tests with this
library to catch collisions that otherwise would be missed.  

COLLIST imposes no limits on object size.  COLLIST will always find all 
bounding box collisions accurately (to the limit of single-precision 
floating point math anyway), regardless of of object size and position.  

COLLIST can be inefficient sometimes when dealing with maps that MUCH wider 
than they are tall, or much taller than they are wide.  Usually not very 
inefficient though.  

There is no maximum number of objects, except that the number must not 
overflow a signed integer.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRA OPTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some versions of ColList supported wrapping coordinates, but this version
does not.  Hopefully this feature will be added back at some time in the
future.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE TWEAKING:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


As mentioned earlier, if you delete objects using remove_from_collist 
frequently then you should switch to using 
remove_from_collist_during_callback.  Also, at the moment, add_to_collist 
can be kinda slow if called many times in a single frame.  At the moment, 
the only way to speed that up is by calling update_collist(collist) on 
ticks that involved excessively large numbers of additions or slow 
removals.  These performance issues will be addressed in a future version 
of this library.  

If you want the maximum control over how collision detection is done, you 
can call _do_collist_collisions instead of the regular 
do_collist_collisions.  This version has two extra parameters, 
"sort_algorithm" and "complexity".  "sort_algorithm" should usually be 
SORT_BUBBLE, but if your objects are changing VERY fast (usually due to 
large numbers of objects added per tick) then SORT_QSORT can be faster.  
"complexity" is a parameter used internally.  Use 0 to let COLLIST 
autodetect an appropriate complexity, 1 to have it use low complexity 
(fastest when there are few objects), and higher numbers if you have very 
large numbers of objects or if your map axis are extremely unbalanced.  
Generally, complexity should be proportional to the square root of the 
number of objects.
